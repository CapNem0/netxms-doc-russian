  SNMP
    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an "Internet-standard protocol
    for managing devices on IP networks". Devices that typically support SNMP
    include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and
    more. SNMP is used mostly in network management systems to monitor
    network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative
    attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of
    standards for network management, including an application layer protocol,
    a database schema, and a set of data objects.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Simple Network Management Protocol>`.

    model. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <MAC address>`.
  
  VLAN
    In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to
    create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so
    that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a
    domain is referred to as a virtual local area network, virtual LAN or
    VLAN. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual LAN>`.

    It is configurable operation that can be executed on :term:`nodes <Node>`.    
  
  VPN
    A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
    network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or network-enabled
    device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it
    were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the
    functionality, security and management policies of the private network. A
    VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through
    the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic
    encryptions. Major implementations of VPNs include OpenVPN and IPsec.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual private network>`.
  
  LAN
    A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects
    computers within a limited area such as a home, school, computer

    their smaller geographic area, and non-inclusion of leased
    telecommunication lines.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Local area network>`.

    IEEE 802.1X (also known as Dot1x) is an IEEE Standard for Port-based 
    Network Access Control (PNAC). It is part of the IEEE 802.1 group of 
    networking     protocols. It provides an authentication mechanism to devices

    protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite used by network devices for advertising 
    their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on an IEEE 802 local area network, 
    principally wired Ethernet.[1] The protocol is formally referred to by the IEEE 
    as Station and Media Access Control Connectivity Discovery specified in

  STP
    The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free 
    topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP is 
    to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning 
    tree also allows a network design to include spare (redundant) links to provide 
    automatic backup paths if an active link fails, without the danger of bridge loops, 
    or the need for manual enabling/disabling of these backup links.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Spanning Tree Protocol>`
  
  VRRP
    The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a computer networking protocol 
    that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers 
    to participating hosts. This increases the availability and reliability of routing 
    paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol>`

    obtained from :term:`ARP` tables and routing tables of already known devices. In active 
    discovery mode, NetXMS server will send an :term:`ICMP` echo requests to all IP 
    addresses in given range, and consider each responding address for adding to database.
  
  ARP
    The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a telecommunication protocol used for resolution 
    of network layer addresses into link layer addresses, a critical function in 
    multiple-access networks. 
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Address Resolution Protocol>`
  
  Proxy Agent
    It is agent that gives access to other :term:`nodes <Node>` that are not visible from

    Zone in NetXMS is a group of IP subnets which form non-overlapping IP address space. 
    There is always zone 0 which contains subnets directly reachable by management server. 
    For all other zones server assumes that subnets within that zones are not reachable 
    directly, and proxy must be used. It is used to monitor subnets with IP address space. 
  
  Polling
    Polling is process of gathering information by server from nodes. This is usually done 
    automatically at specified intervals of time, but can be triggered manually also. There 
    are different types of polling: Status, Configuration, Topology, Discovery and Routing.
