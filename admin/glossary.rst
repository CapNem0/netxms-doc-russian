    computer software.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Globally unique identifier>`

  ICMP
    The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the main protocols
    of the Internet Protocol Suite. It is used by network devices, like
    routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested
    service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Internet Control Message Protocol>`.

  LAN
    A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects
    computers within a limited area such as a home, school, computer
    laboratory, or office building, using network media. The defining
    characteristics of LANs, in contrast to wide area networks (WANs), include
    their smaller geographic area, and non-inclusion of leased
    telecommunication lines.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Local area network>`.

  LDAP
    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP; /ˈɛldæp/) is an open, vendor-neutral,
    industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed
    directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Lightweight Directory Access Protocol>`

  LLDP
    The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a vendor-neutral link layer
    protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite used by network devices for advertising
    their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on an IEEE 802 local area network,
    principally wired Ethernet.[1] The protocol is formally referred to by the IEEE
    as Station and Media Access Control Connectivity Discovery specified in
    standards document IEEE 802.1AB.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Link Layer Discovery Protocol>`

  MAC address
    A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier
    assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network
    segment. MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802
    network technologies, including Ethernet and WiFi. Logically, MAC addresses
    are used in the media access control protocol sublayer of the OSI reference
    model. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <MAC address>`.

  NDP
    The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol
    suite used with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Neighbor Discovery Protocol>`

  RADIUS
    Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that
    provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management
    for users who connect and use a network service.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <RADIUS>`

  SMCLP
    Server Management Command Line Protocol

  SNMP
    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an "Internet-standard protocol
    for managing devices on IP networks". Devices that typically support SNMP
    include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and
    more. SNMP is used mostly in network management systems to monitor
    network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative
    attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of
    standards for network management, including an application layer protocol,
    a database schema, and a set of data objects.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Simple Network Management Protocol>`.

  SNMP Trap
    Asynchronous notification from :term:`SNMP` agent to :term:`SNMP` manager.
    SNMP traps enable an agent to notify the management station of significant
    events by way of an unsolicited SNMP message.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Simple Network Management Protocol#Trap>`.

  STP
    The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free
    topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP is
    to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning
    tree also allows a network design to include spare (redundant) links to provide
    automatic backup paths if an active link fails, without the danger of bridge loops,
    or the need for manual enabling/disabling of these backup links.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Spanning Tree Protocol>`

  Syslog
    Widely used standard for message logging.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Syslog>`.

  UPS
    An uninterruptible power supply, also uninterruptible power source, UPS or
    battery/flywheel backup, is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a
    load when the input power source, typically mains power, fails.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Uninterruptible Power Supply>`

  URL
    A uniform resource locator (URL) is a reference to a resource that specifies the location
    of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Uniform resource locator>`

  VLAN
    In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to
    create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so
    that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a
    domain is referred to as a virtual local area network, virtual LAN or
    VLAN. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual LAN>`.

  VPN
    A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
    network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or network-enabled
    device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it
    were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the
    functionality, security and management policies of the private network. A
    VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through
    the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic
    encryptions. Major implementations of VPNs include OpenVPN and IPsec.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual private network>`.

  VRRP
    The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a computer networking protocol
    that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers
    to participating hosts. This increases the availability and reliability of routing
    paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol>`
