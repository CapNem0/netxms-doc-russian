  Alarm Browser
    View, which shows all active alarms in the system and provides tools to 
    interact with them.
  
  Audit entry
    An important user actions that is written to audit log.

    Automatically generated object hierarchy that contains all nodes and 
    IP subnets known to NetXMS.

    GNU General Public License.
    
  ICMP
    The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the main protocols
    of the Internet Protocol Suite. It is used by network devices, like
    routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested
    service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Internet Control Message Protocol>`.
    
  Metric
    Data Collection Item, configuration element, which contains parameter to 
    collect (for example “CPU Usage”), collection schedule and thresholds.
  
  DCI 
    Data Collection Item, alternative name for :term:`Metric`.
    
  MIB Explorer
    View, which allows to navigate SNMP MIB tree.
    
  Node
    Object that represents server or device, virtual or physical.
  
  Object
    Representation of logical or physical entity.     
    
  Object Browser
    :term:`View` where are seen all created :term:`objects<Object>` available 
    for current user.
  
  Object Details
    :term:`View` where is seen available information for currently selected 
    :term:`Object` from :term:`Object Browser`
    
  SNMP
    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an "Internet-standard protocol
    for managing devices on IP networks". Devices that typically support SNMP
    include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks and
    more. SNMP is used mostly in network management systems to monitor
    network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative
    attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of
    standards for network management, including an application layer protocol,
    a database schema, and a set of data objects.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Simple Network Management Protocol>`.
    
  SNMP Trap
    Asynchronous notification from :term:`SNMP` agent to :term:`SNMP` manager.
    SNMP traps enable an agent to notify the management station of significant
    events by way of an unsolicited SNMP message.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Simple Network Management Protocol#Trap>`.
    
  Trim Stack
    :term:`View Stack` in minimized state, represented as a set of buttons,
    one for each View in the stack.
    
  View Stack
    Multiple views combined into single one, with tab navigation on top of it.
    
  Condition
    (Create condition in infrastructure services)

  MAC address
    A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier
    assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network
    segment. MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802
    network technologies, including Ethernet and WiFi. Logically, MAC addresses
    are used in the media access control protocol sublayer of the OSI reference
    model. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <MAC address>`.
  
  VLAN
    In computer networking, a single layer-2 network may be partitioned to
    create multiple distinct broadcast domains, which are mutually isolated so
    that packets can only pass between them via one or more routers; such a
    domain is referred to as a virtual local area network, virtual LAN or
    VLAN. More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual LAN>`.

  VPN
    A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
    network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or network-enabled
    device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it
    were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the
    functionality, security and management policies of the private network. A
    VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through
    the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic
    encryptions. Major implementations of VPNs include OpenVPN and IPsec.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Virtual private network>`.
  
  LAN
    A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects
    computers within a limited area such as a home, school, computer
    laboratory, or office building, using network media. The defining
    characteristics of LANs, in contrast to wide area networks (WANs), include
    their smaller geographic area, and non-inclusion of leased
    telecommunication lines.
    More details in :wikipedia:`Wikipedia <Local area network>`.
  
  NetXMS Agent
    NetXMS daemon that is installed on monitored :term:`Node` to 
    provide additional monitoring options.  
    
  Monitoring Agent 
    NetXMS or SNMP agent that provides information to :term:`NetXMS Server`.
