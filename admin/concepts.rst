Architecture overview
=====================

The system has three-tier architecture: the information is collected by 
monitoring agents (either our own high-performance agents or SNMP agents) 
and delivered to monitoring server for processing and storage. Network 
administrator can access collected data using cross-platform Management 
Console, Web Interface or Management Console for Android. Having been 
designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, NetXMS features a wide 
range of supported platforms, leaving you the freedom of choice of platform(s) 
for your network.
